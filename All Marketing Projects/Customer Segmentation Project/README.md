# Description

**This customer segmentation RFM analysis marketing analytics project is based on app usage data collected from survey data. The project focuses on identifying customer segments based on their usage of the app, as well as their likelihood to engage with marketing activities.**

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) framework is used to organize the app usage data into three categories: Recency (how recently a customer has used the app), Frequency (how often a customer uses the app), and Monetary (the amount of money the customer has spent on the app). The data is then segmented into various customer segments based on their RFM scores. The goal of this project is to identify which customer segments are most likely to respond to marketing activities, as well as which activities are most likely to generate a positive response. By understanding customer segments and their usage of the app, this project will help the organization create a more effective marketing strategy.
