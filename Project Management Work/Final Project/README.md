# Project Scope

The project's goal is to alter the way customers purchase food from restaurants online. Compared to traveling to the food court, where you would have to wait and eat, this procedure saves time and is simpler and faster. The primary goal of the project is to reduce the amount of human data entry and streamline the ordering process for both customers and restaurants.

# Project Objective

1. To create an online food ordering application, which includes multiple features such as the ability to filter food choices by different cuisine types, distance, price, and other food categories. 
2. Placing orders in the application, by adding food items to the cart, making online payments, confirming customer details, and asking for customer reviews post-delivery. 
3. Further, a working tracking feature will be delivered, where the customer will receive updates for when their order is being prepared, dispatched, etc.
4. An invoicing feature will be added as well, where a digital receipt will be generated for the customer and will be mailed to their provided email address or phone number. 
5. A working backend feature will be created where restaurant owners can update their restaurant menus on their own from the app directly.
