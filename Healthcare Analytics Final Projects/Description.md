#Description
This Healthcare Analytics Project explores wait times for priority procedures across Canada. 
We have analyzed the amount of time it takes for patients to receive priority procedures from the time they first request them. 
We have analyzed data from multiple hospitals and provinces in order to understand the wait times for priority procedures and any variations across Canada. 
Our analysis will also examine the impact of these wait times on patient outcomes and satisfaction. 
Finally, we will develop recommendations for healthcare providers to reduce wait times and improve patient experiences.
